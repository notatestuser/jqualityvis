JQualityVis
===========

JQualityVis is a software quality analysis framework that allows engineers to 
visualise the results of static software metrics on parsed source code.

Development of this tool constituted the programming portion of my undergraduate 
final year project, hence the omission of any kind of automated testing to get 
functionality pumped out as quickly as humanly possible while I was running solely 
on caffeine.

There's also a monster of a dissertation piece lingering about somewhere. No, you 
really don't want it.
