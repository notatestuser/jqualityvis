                <h2>Creating a Project</h2>
                <p>
                    A Project represents a software solution and/or system being analysed by JQualityVis 
                    and consists of several source code compilation units (source files) and some contextual settings.
   				</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Browse to <strong>File &gt; Create New Project...</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Enter a <strong>Project Name</strong> and select the <strong>Source Root Directory</strong> containing
                    the software's source code files.</li>
                  <li>Select the <strong>Source Language</strong> to instruct the parser how to interpret the files.</li>
                    <li>Configure other options such as the additional classpath string and whether to <strong>Preload Metric 
                    Measurements</strong>.<br />
                This may increase the responsiveness of the user interface in exchange for an additional load wait.</li>
                    <li>Wait for the parsing and analysis processes to complete. A new workspace pane will open upon completion.</li>
                </ol>
                
                
                <h2>Loading an Existing Project File</h2>
                <p>
                    Projects can be loaded from serialised XML or binary file formats. Please note that metric measurements
                    are not stored in the project file; all metrics must be computed again from the program models stored within.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Browse to <strong>File &gt; Open Project...</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Use the <strong>Browse...</strong> finder to select the Project file desired for loading.</li>
                  <li>Select the relevant import options based on the format of the file. An incorrect selection will 
                  yield an error.</li>
                  <li>Choose whether to <strong>Preload Metric Measurements</strong>.This may increase the responsiveness of 
                  the user interface in exchange for an additional load wait.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2>Saving a Project File</h2>
                <p>
                    As with loading Project files, they can be saved by the program in XML or binary file formats, with the option 
                    to compress the output file using GZIP compression.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Browse to <strong>File &gt; Save Project...</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Use the <strong>Browse...</strong> finder to select the target path in which to save the Project file.</li>
                    <li>Select the relevant export options based on the format desired of the file. GZIP compression shall 
                    reduce the size of the output file if chosen.</li>
                </ol>
                
                
                <h2>Displaying Metric Measurements</h2>
                <p>
                	Viewing the metric measurements associated with a particular structural program unit and its children is as simple as 
                    selecting the unit in the <strong>Project Explorer</strong> and observing the lower contextual pane.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The left portion of the contextual pane displays the metric measurements associated with the selected component and, 
                        in some cases, details of its composition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The right portion of the contextual pane displays a tabular listing of the selected component's children and the 
                        applicable metrics, along with their measurements when applied to each child component.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                	<i>Note:</i> The <strong>Batch Metric Calculator</strong> accessible from the <strong>Tools</strong> menu can also be used 
                    to calculate metrics in batch mode across an entire Project at ease.
                </p>
                
                
                <h2>Displaying a Visualisation</h2>
                <p>
                	Visualisations may be activated once a component and an individual metric to measure its constituent component(s) with has 
                    been selected from the <strong>Quality Analysis</strong> pane.
                </p>
                <ol>
                	<li>Ensure that a container component (such as a Project, Package or compound Class) is selected in the 
                    <strong>Project Explorer</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Choose either the <strong>tree</strong> or <strong>fancy</strong> metrics selector tab from within the 
                    <strong>Quality Analysis</strong> pane and select the metric to compute.</li>
                    <li>Select the desired visualisation to show from the second combo box (fancy selector) or the child tree node 
                    (tree selector).</li>
                    <li>The visualisation is now displayed in the workspace pane.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                	<i>Note:</i> The selected program component can be changed while a metric is selected. Holding SHIFT and clicking multiple 
                	program components will add them to the rendered visualisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                	The <strong>Breakdown</strong> tab within the <strong>Quality Analysis</strong> pane shows a simple diagram depicting which 
                    characteristics of the component are being measured to attain the visualised metric result values.
                </p>
                
                
                <h2>Managing Project Settings</h2>
                <p>
                	Projects have several settings associated with them that can be modified by the user. These include the Project's name, creator
                    and a set of <strong>Metric Thresholds</strong> that are used to determine when to show warnings in the 
                    <strong>Thresholds</strong> tab of the <strong>Quality Analysis</strong> pane.
                </p>
                <ol>
                	<li>Browse to <strong>Settings &gt; Project Settings...</strong> with a Project workspace pane selected.</li>
                    <li>Configure the displayed values using the edit boxes and configuration buttons.</li>
                    <li>Changes will be reflected in the interface upon clicking the <strong>Save Entity</strong> button and closing the window.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                	<i>Note:</i> Any metric can be given a threshold range and the default values are attained from that metric's definition in the 
                    program's settings files. These defaults can be changed using the <strong>Metric Manager</strong>.
                </p>
                
                
                <h2>Managing Metrics and Visualisations</h2>
              	<p>
                	Metrics and Visualisations are the two principle behavioural definitions that govern the functionality that JQualityVis offers. 
                    While they are both defined in external configuration files, the program offers a simple management interface to allow a user to 
                    add, edit and remove them without having to open a text editor.
                </p>
                <ol>
                	<li>Open the desired management window (<strong>Edit Metrics...</strong> or <strong>Edit Visualisations...</strong>) 
           	  from the <strong>Settings</strong> menu.</li>
              		<li>Currently available entries are displayed on the left. A form is provided on the right to enter the details required to add
                    or amend an existing entry.</li>
                    <li>After changes have been made, use the <strong>Commit to Disk</strong> button to write the list of entries, including their 
                    amendments, to the external XML file. Changes will now persist between application starts.</li>
             	</ol>
